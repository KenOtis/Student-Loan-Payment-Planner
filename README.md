# Student-Loan-Payment-Planner
This Script will create a student loan payment plan for you calculating both the flat rate and also caluculing 
the pice with the given intrest rate.

There are 6 functions in this script. 

The first function in this script is the AmountLST. This function colects information from the user such as the loan amount,
and the intrest rate of the loan. This information is then appened into a list and then returns the data. 

The second fucntion is AmountOfTime. This fucntion lets the user determine the amount of time they would like to pay off their loan in. 
Once the amount of time is determined, the code will then execute an equation to determine the monthly payment required to pay off the 
loan in the given amount of time. 

At the moment of writing this, the code does work in determing the amount to be payed each month, but without the intrest. 
I need to figure our how to calulate the monthly payments accurately with intrest, with the intrest of each loan being different percentages.
